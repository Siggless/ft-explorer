FT/BLCMM Explorer Sandbox
=========================

I've been steadily accumulating a collection of little utilities which
make use of FT Explorer's data introspection abilities.  These are
generally written off-the-cuff, intended to be used once or twice during
the creation of a mod, and generally never to be looked at again.  I'm
a bit of a digital packrat, though, and can rarely convince myself to
delete stuff which could maybe be useful in the future.  These have
been growing enough that I figured I may as well put them in a "sandbox"
dir in here.

These are provided without any guarantee of workability - older ones
may not work against modern FT Explorer (though I'm not actually aware
of any incompatibilities), and older ones will of course not make use
of any fancier functions available in FT Explorer from after they were
written.  Stuff tends to get added to FT Explorer as I go along with
these.

Anyway, they're also provided without any semblance of index or whatever.
You'll have to figure out for yourself what these are supposed to do,
if it's not already commented in the files themselves.
