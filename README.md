FilterTool/BLCMM Explorer (ft-explorer)
=======================================

This is a little Python 3 / PyQt5 application to enable tree-based
browsing of the resource data used by the excellent Borderlands 2/TPS
modding tool [FilterTool](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/UCP-Filter-Tool),
and its successor, BLCMM.

BLCMM somewhat obsoletes this application, since it includes tree-based
browsing of data inside its Object Explorer (unlike FilterTool, which
didn't).  BLCMM breaks up the data into various categories, though, and
doesn't provide the total top-down tree view that this app does, so
this app may still have some limited usefulness 

I threw this together originally because I like the way
[UE Explorer](http://eliotvu.com/portfolio/view/21/ue-explorer) lets you
browse around Borderlands objects in a nice tree format, but using
UE Explorer is often a bit cumbersome: it doesn't work fantastically under
Wine *(I'm running Linux)*, it'll often require tweaks to its settings to
properly display some properties, and you've got to know or guess which UPK
file you need to look in to find what you're looking for.

Similarly, FilterTool was great for searching around and viewing Borderlands
data, because it contains an awful lot of pre-dumped object data.
However, even though it's got an autocomplete-like function, in its editor
component, I often found myself missing the GUI browsing which UE Explorer
provides.  *(As I mentioned above, BLCMM does close much of that gap on its
own, making this app less useful.)*

So, enter this app!  It takes the FilterTool/BLCMM pre-dumped data and
presents it in a tree, like UE Explorer would do.

Requirements
------------

This is a Python 3 + PyQt5 application.  It's been developed entirely on
Linux, but it works just fine in Windows (and should in Mac as well) so long as
you've got the necessary stuff installed, though Linux folks will have the
easiest time of it.

**Linux:** You may already have these installed via your package manager,
but if not, just use your package manger to install a package named something
like `python-pyqt5` or `pyqt5` or the like, and that should take care of it
for you.

**Windows/Mac:** Install the latest Python 3.x.x version from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  Hop out to a commandline or
terminal and see if running the command `python -V` outputs something like
`Python 3.6.4`.  If so, try just running `pip install PyQt5` or `pip3 install
PyQt5`.  If that seemed to work, you may be good to go at that point!  I'm
afraid I can't help out much with install issues on Windows, though.

Usage
-----

Simply run `ft-explorer.py` and it should do its thing.  If that's not
working, try running it from a commandline/terminal/console, to see if it's
printing out any error messages.

The data from BLCMM 1.0 (for Borderlands 2) and FilterTool 2.2 (for The
Pre-Sequel) is bundled with the application, thanks to LightChaosman.  There
is no need to copy anything over from FilterTool or BLCMM.

You can add data to the resource library if you want, in the
`resources/BL2/dumps` and `resources/TPS/dumps` directories.  The files must
have the extensions `.dump.xz` or `.txt.xz` *([lzma/lzma2
compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz))*.  Additionally, the utility
`generate_indexes.py` must be run whenever the data files are changed, to
update the indexes that the app uses to avoid having to load all the data
into memory at once.  Note that index generation takes quite awhile, since
I've not bothered to try optimizing it.

Setting the Font
----------------

FT Explorer is set to use whatever Monospace font your system considers the
default, which may not be the font you want to use in the main data area.
There's no way to set this font inside the FT Explorer GUI, but you can edit
its configuration file once it's been run once to set the font however you
like.  The location of the file will depend on your platform:

* **Windows:** `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Apocalyptech\FT Explorer.conf`
* **Mac:** `$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.Apocalyptech.FT Explorer.plist`
* **Linux:** `$HOME/.config/Apocalyptech/FT Explorer.conf`

Specifically, set the `datafont` attribute in the `[mainwindow]` section.
The font size can be specified in this file as well, though you can change
the font size in the main application by holding down `Ctrl` and using your
mouse wheel.

Status

This is a pretty quick-and-dirty app, and is unlikely to see much in the
way of feature improvements, or concessions to platforms other than Linux,
mostly because I assume I'm probably the only person who'll ever use it.
If there's Actual Interest from other folks, I'm guessing I could be
convinced to spend some more effort on it.

Some things which are at least somewhat likely to happen:

* See if there's a way to support doing keyboard things like shift-End to
  select a whole line, etc, without having to disable readonly mode.

Some things which are less likely to happen:

* Proper packaging *(for any platform)*
* Fancy icons and stuff in the tree
* While I have no intention of adding searching to the app, it *would*
  be useful to at least be able to `Ctrl-F` while looking at an object and
  be able to search within the displayed text.  I suspect that may be
  more work than I'm willing to put in, but it's a tempting thought...
* While the initial loading time isn't awful -- *~10sec on my machine* --
  it may not be a terrible idea to have a little "loading" dialog pop up
  during the initial load, to provide a bit of user feedback.  Would only
  be able to update for the index loads and the tree population, but it'd
  be better than nothing.

Some things which are absolutely not going to happen:

* Searching *(FilterTool/BLCMM already does a great job at this)*
